## 👁️ Observations  

- Dataset covered **6 products**, **4 regions**, and **12 months**.  
- Equal number of customers and orders across all regions.  
- Product and regional sales varied significantly.  
- Monthly sales showed visible volatility with clear peaks and dips.  
- **Shoes** and **Shirts** dominated revenue generation.  
- **September** was the lowest-performing month.  
- Some products consistently outperformed others across all regions.

## 🔍 Key Insights  

### 🏷️ Product Performance  
- **Shoes** generated the highest total sales: **$3.09M**, showing strong market demand.  
- **Shirts** had the highest **average sales per order ($326.67)**, indicating premium pricing.  
- **Socks** and **Jackets** recorded the lowest sales and average revenue.  

### 📆 Monthly Sales Trends  
- **February** was the best-performing month (**$2.75M**) — possibly due to seasonal promotions.  
- **September** had the lowest sales (**$0.18M**).  
- **Quantity sold** peaked in **February** and **June (50K units)** indicating seasonal demand.  
-**Lowest quantity sold was recorded in **May** and **December** with both having 13K units sold, signaling a potential gap in marketing or customer engagement.
- Sales fluctuations likely reflect seasonality or campaign timing.  
- Revenue and quantity were not always aligned, this suggest pricing impacted performance more than volume.  

### 🌍 Regional Analysis  
- All regions had equal order counts (**12.5K**), but sales value and volume varied widely, showing differences in customer purchasing power.
- **South Region** led with **44% of total sales ($4.68M)** and had the highest average sales ($374) and quantity sold (123K units).  
- **West Region** recorded the lowest performance across all metrics despite having the same number of orders and customers as other regions.  
- **East** and **West regions** had the highest product diversity, each selling 4 different products, suggesting broader market acceptance or inventory variety.


### 👥 Customer Insights  
- Equal customer count per region (**500 each**) — suggests data assumption or opportunity for deeper segmentation.  
- Despite equal distribution, customer purchasing behavior varied regionally. An insight worth deeper exploration.
